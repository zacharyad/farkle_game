### Farkle Game coded out with Vanilla Javascript

## This is a simple dice game that allows for players to be added to game, and the game to progress

# This is going through iterations of development. Currently the code will tally up the best score off of a single roll. Soon the functionality will be to isolate how ever many dice you want and reroll the others to try and get better score. The goal is to fully mimc the game of Farkle with a web experience all while only using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla Javascript.
